# Aviation Safety Action Program: Stock Market Evidence Regarding Public Policy

This research explores the financial impact of the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) on the airline industry. Leveraging event study methodology, the study analyzes stock market reactions to air disasters pre- and post-ASAP implementation (1997).

Key Findings:

- Pre-ASAP: Inconclusive evidence, with average abnormal returns showing no significant negative effects on the market.
- Post-ASAP: Clear negative reactions within a 10-day window, indicating a faster market response possibly influenced by increased internet use and major events like September 11.

Methodology:

- Employs the Fama-French three-factor model to predict normal returns and calculate abnormal returns.
- Utilizes a dataset of 30 air disasters, 15 pre-ASAP and 15 post-ASAP, from 1982 to 2018.
